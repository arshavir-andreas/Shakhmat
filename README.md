## Why Shakhmat?

As far as I know, a lot of chess players in my country (including me) are not really proficient at PGN notation. Even though chess platforms like Chess.com or Lichess.org propose some ways to learn that notation, I personally found that was a bit awkward to master. That's the reason why Shakhmat was created: **why not just playing against a chess engine by using PGN notation from the very beginning until the end of a game**?

It is a didactic approach inspired by ***Blindfold chess***.

##### Chess skills enhancement

By playing regularly against chess engines by using Shakhmat, users will be proficient at PGN notation.

PGN notation mastering has some advantages:

1. They will learn openings more easily.
2. It will be straightforward for them to memorize openings sidelines and variations.
3. They will recognize and assimilate tactical patterns easier.
4. Their calculation abilities will be improved.

##### Modern and responsive user interface:

##### Friendly error handling:

##### Highly performant web application (Excellent user experience)

That web application is written in:

* Next.TS:
  - High performance, thanks to Server-Side Rendering.
* ASP.NET Core Minimal API:
  - Very high performant and low-latency data retrievals and updates.
* Oracle DB:
  - High performant and scalable enterprise database.

## Getting started

##### Using Docker

###### Requirements:

- Docker
- Arasan UCI engine
- Stockfish UCI engine

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshavir-andreas/Shakhmat
```

1. Extract the Arasan binary executable and all its related files to the ***Shakhmat/server/wwwroot/engines/arasan*** directory.
2. Extract the Stockfish binary executable to the ***Shakhmat/server/wwwroot/engines/stockfish*** directory.

   > Rename the Stockfish binary executable to: *stockfish-x86-64*
   >

Then run:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Wait for the CLI displaying: "*dotnet watch ðŸš€ Started*".

Then, open a new terminal and launch this command:

```bash
sh ./oracle-db.init.sh <your-oracle-db-SYSTEM-user-password>
```

> To run the server tests, wait for the CLI displaying: "*server_tests exited with code 0*" and open a new terminal:
>
> ```bash
> docker exec server_tests sh -c "dotnet test"
> ```

Finally, open [**http://localhost:3000/sign-up**](http://localhost:3000/sign-up) in your favorite browser, and create your account.
